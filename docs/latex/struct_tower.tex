\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Array of \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_piece}{Piece}}. 

Every piece used in the game is a tower, starting from height = 1, it can grow taller by conquering different pieces. The first element of the tower, placed in position 0, is the one that controls the tower, also indicating it\textquotesingle{}s color. When the tower gets conquered, that is the piece that gets conquered along with its same color pieces, while the rest of the pieces (of the opposite color) are left in position to create a new tower.
